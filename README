Adds semantic highlighting to C/C++ symbols

Details

Assigns the color of a C/C++ symbol using the hash of the symbol string as a key to a color table that spans the line between minimum and maximum hue. Color table customizable by editing script. Behavior of color assignment customizable by editing hash function.

Known defects

- The 'define' in a '#define' preprocessor definition may be incorrectly colorized.

- The semantic parsing algorithm is approximately O(n). Where 'n' is the number of non-syntax symbols in a buffer. Large files may be slow to process on your machine.

- Only available in gvim.
